# OS Memory Management Project

## Overview
This project is a memory management application developed for the Operating Systems course at Universidade do Vale do Itaja√≠ (UNIVALI), created by [Alexandre Debortoli de Souza](https://github.com/alexandredebortoli) and [Bernar Duarte Freitas](https://github.com/bernarDuarte). The course was instructed by Professor Felipe Viel.

## Description
This application is designed to convert virtual addresses to page numbers and offsets, allowing you to read data from memory files based on these addresses. It is written in C++ and supports both normal and two-level pagination for 32-bit virtual addresses.

## Features
- Converts virtual addresses to page numbers and offsets.
- Supports both normal and two-level pagination for 32-bit virtual addresses.
- Reads data from memory files using the converted addresses.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository.
2. Compile the C++ code using your preferred C++ compiler (e.g., `g++`).
3. Run the compiled executable.
4. Follow the on-screen prompts or provide command-line arguments as required.
